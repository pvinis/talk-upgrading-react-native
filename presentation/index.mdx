upgrading RN EU talk


qna form?


bio:
Hello, my name is Pavlos. Writing code is my hobby and my job. I enjoy making things that work, work well, work easy, mostly in that order!

title:
Upgrading React Native apps now and in the future.
Let's upgrade your React Native app!

abstract: (?)
Upgrading React Native projects has been a painful process since the beginning. There have been ways to make this process easier, but it’s still not as simple as running one command. What will it take to make this happen?
Let’s take a good look at the upgrading process as a whole, the hard parts, the automatic steps and everything in between.

#### Past: pain

it was the highest voted thing that people dislike about rn
people love RN.                           people love fresh RN.
people love RN.      upgrade..      people love fresh RN.
thats the dreadful part for many.
it is hard because not everyone is an expert on ios, android, js/ts eco, at the same time.
ios has cocoapods, carthage
android has gradle
js/ts has packages like babel, metro, eslint, tsc
upGrade was just change the package number, yarn install, and see if it works. some devs had ideas to automate this, and we got the original `react-native upgrade`, `rnpm upgrade`, `react-native-git-upgrade`, the rn-diff repo, rn-diff-purge. suffice it to say there were many iterations.
kept rn-diff with a list of patches genarated from upgrading a simple rn app, that other users could apply. i found that and always manually upgraded, since that way i had a good idea of what changed. after a while, that got hard to maintain, so guess what, (xkcd about the frameworks +1) i forked rn-diff and made rn-diff-purge since it had to change the gen script enough. so it was easier as a fork. i wanted it for me, as i was and am still a fan of manual upgrading.

#### current work

purge seems to be the most stable and consistent way to do the upgrades using this way (this way is to get the template, old and new, and compare).
purge-web is a simple interface to get the manual diffs
in 0.59 @thymikee already made rn-cli to do `react-native upgrade` using the purge way, and we will improve on this.
there is also work done @watadarkstar to take the simple purge-web and supercharge it, so users can have one place they can go, adn no matter if they prefer manual, automatic or whatever, they can get instructions to complete the upgrade.
(of course each project is unique and we can never cover everyone, but we can cover most people, and most rn core related things. everything else that someone might add, it kind of becomes their responsibility to make sure it works after an upgrade)

try the link-less for android and maybe cocoapods for ios
