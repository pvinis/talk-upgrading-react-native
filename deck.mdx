You need to know all:
- JS/TS
- iOS
- Android

<Notes>
its hard because
</Notes>

---

### iOS

- ObjC/Swift
- complicated `xcodeproj` files and `scheme`s and `config`s
- `carthage`, `cocoapods`, `manual` ways to link libraries
- Xcode

---

### Android

- Java/Kotlin
- `gradle` scripts
- Android Studio

---

### `expo` exists

- it's `awesome`
- it helps people build apps without the need to go native

<Appear>

...until you `need` to go native

</Appear>

<Notes>
need to eject, and back to the hard part
</Notes>

---

### JS/TS

- `babel`, `metro`, `eslint`, `typescript`, ...
- `net-info`, `keep-awake`, `async-storage`, ...

<Notes>
only js easy

native too can go easy

can go very hard
</Notes>

---

upgrading `react` on the web meant:

- change the version number
- yarn install
- see if it works

<Notes>
by running tests or click around
</Notes>

---

upgrading `react native` meant:

- change the version number
- yarn install
- see if it works
- fix native stuff
- see if it works
- fix libraries native stuff
- see if it works
- google things
- see if it works

<Notes>
almost the same
</Notes>

---

"Let's automate this"

- original `react-native upgrade`
- `rnpm upgrade`
- `react-native-git-upgrade`
- `rn-diff` repo

<Notes>
some great people thought:

thats how we got:

suffice it to say there were many iterations.

#### current work

purge seems to be the most stable and consistent way to do the upgrades using this way (this way is to get the template, old and new, and compare).
purge-web is a simple interface to get the manual diffs
in 0.59 @thymikee already made rn-cli to do `react-native upgrade` using the purge way, and we will improve on this.
there is also work done @watadarkstar to take the simple purge-web and supercharge it, so users can have one place they can go, adn no matter if they prefer manual, automatic or whatever, they can get instructions to complete the upgrade.
(of course each project is unique and we can never cover everyone, but we can cover most people, and most rn core related things. everything else that someone might add, it kind of becomes their responsibility to make sure it works after an upgrade)

upgrading RN EU talk

30min or 10min



why i like upgrading

give me betas and take my soul


qna form?


make a slide with stuff added in each release, and say that its also a bunch of fixes. Itterally, “a bunch”




ng the scope of this issue but if you have the desire to answer further I would appreciate the help.
Essentially react-native upgrade was not working for me so I am going the manual route. The first link you have provided for the upgrade guide is what I have been referencing.
However, it's a bit confusing.
Am I supposed to literally update the MODIFIED files by pasting in the changes?
When a file is ADDED how do you know it's proper location in the project?
For ios/Podfile which was added, do to add all of those pods somewhere specific? Or just the text above the message "All these libraries below have been removed from the Xcode project file and now live in the Podfile. Cocoapods handles the linking now. Here you can add more libraries with native modules."? What about all the pods below?
Thanks for your time. Sorry it's just that this upgrade process isn't very clear to me.
