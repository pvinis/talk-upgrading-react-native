I enjoy making things that:

- `work`
- work `well`
- work `simply`

mostly in that order.

People love React Native

People love `fresh` React Native

comes every so often

per 2 weeks, 1 month, big feature

You need to know all:
- JS/TS
- iOS
- Android

<Notes>
its hard because
</Notes>

---

### iOS

- ObjC/Swift
- complicated `xcodeproj` files and `scheme`s and `config`s
- `carthage`, `cocoapods`, `manual` ways to link libraries
- Xcode

---

### Android

- Java/Kotlin
- `gradle` scripts
- Android Studio

---

### `expo` exists

- it's `awesome`
- it helps people build apps without the need to go native

<Appear>

...until you `need` to go native

</Appear>

<Notes>
need to eject, and back to the hard part
</Notes>

---

### JS/TS

- `babel`, `metro`, `eslint`, `typescript`, ...
- `netinfo`, `keep-awake`, `async-storage`, ...

<Notes>
only js easy

native too can go easy

can go very hard
</Notes>

---

upgrading `react` on the web meant:

- change the version number
- yarn install
- see if it works

<Notes>
by running tests or click around
</Notes>

---

upgrading `react native` meant:

- change the version number
- yarn install
- see if it works
- fix native stuff
- see if it works
- upgrade libraries
- see if it works
- fix libraries native stuff
- see if it works
- google things
- see if it works

<Notes>
almost the same
</Notes>

---

"Let's automate this"

- original `react-native upgrade`
- `rnpm upgrade`
- `react-native-git-upgrade`
- `rn-diff` repo

<Notes>
some great people thought:

cant be avoided

thats how we got:

suffice it to say there were many iterations.
</Notes>

---

I never liked using any of the `automated` tools ðŸ˜…

I only used `rn-diff`

---

### my flow

- get `notification` for new release
- read the `release notes` and `change log`
- go to `rn-diff` to see the `diff`, or `generate` it
- go `file-by-file` and make the changes manually

Upgrading `manually` helped me understand `what changed` in my projects

I `almost never` had a problem

<Notes>
https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff

when i had a problem it was because there was a difference between my code and the template
</Notes>

---

## Present: `pretty good`

---

- `rn-diff-purge`
- `upgrade-helper`
- `npx react-native upgrade` (`cli`)

---

### rn-diff-purge

- stood on the shoulders of the people and repos before me
- tries to remove all previous problems
- I wanted this for my projects

<Notes>
https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/tree/old/master

problems:

- linear upgrading, grid is better, rc
- github diffing cant handle branches

like most open source.. for me to use, happy if anyone else uses it too
</Notes>

---

### rn-diff-purge

- keeps a list of diffs `from -> to` every release
- `generated` by a script
- each release gets a branch

---

### rn-diff-purge

- based on the project init `template`
- start a new `branch`
- `init` a new project
- `diff` and keep as a patch file

<Notes>

https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge

show the grid

init using the new release

from -> every other release, with the current release

even downgrades

</Notes>

---

### rn-diff-purge

- base of our current upgrade flow
- people already used the idea for `laravel` and `ignite bowser`
- soon a template repo on github, ready to be cloned and reused

<Notes>
create-react-app

links at the end
</Notes>

---

### upgrade-helper

- started as `purge-web`, just pointing to the `diff` file
- allows to chose a `from` and a `to` release
- gives all the changes of the `init template`
- uses `rn-diff-purge`
- steadily becoming `more awesome`

---

### upgrade-helper

- better visuals
- `github-like` diff views
- see `raw` files
- file `folding`
- `links` to release notes
- notes `explaining` changes
- logo and party popper ðŸŽ‰
- support for `rc releases`

<Notes>
https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/
</Notes>

---

### npx react-native upgrade (cli)

- just run `npx react-native upgrade`
- uses `rn-diff-purge`
- tries to `apply` the diff

It might not work because of differences between the template and each project

<Notes>

each project is unique

cant cover everyone, but we can cover most people, and most rn core related things

it kind of becomes your responsibility to make sure it works after an upgrade

- typescript
- fancy eslint config
- xcconfigs
- tvos

</Notes>

<Notes>
thanks to these wonderful people for their time and effort

everyone else i forgot

you for helping in the future
</Notes>

---

### current flow

- get `notification` for new release
- read the `release notes` and `change log`
- try `npx react-native upgrade`
- get diff from `upgrade-helper`
- go `file-by-file` and make the changes manually
- start with `config` and `js` stuff, then `iOS`, then `Android` native
- make sure `any custom additions` are compatible and working
- `test` to make sure things still work
- use hooks or whatever `cool new feature` is in that new release or rc ðŸ’ª

<Notes>

new release, get excited

https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases

https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/?from=0.59.10&to=0.60.0

npx r-n upgrade, even if its not perfect, report issues

</Notes>

---

### tips

- manual does not mean `slow`, it means `careful`
- be mindful of `what changed`
- `pick and choose` your changes
- try to `stay up to date`
- try not to `jump` too many versions
- `xcodeproj` needs to be similarly changed

<Notes>

file by file means we pick and choose. maybe we skip a file, maybe we dont need it.

manual is not slow. its careful

xcode you need to change things in xcode, and see the diff

it will be easier in the future

</Notes>

---

## Future: `awesome`

---

- `autolinking` and standardization of some tools
- `rn-diff-purge` diff generation on CI
- investigating into tools to make things easier and decoupled like `xcodegen` etc

<Notes>

with help with the upgrading, not so many differences

same as with cocoapods

</Notes>
