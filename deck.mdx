You need to know all:
- JS/TS
- iOS
- Android

---

### iOS

- ObjC/Swift
- Complicated `xcodeproj` files and `scheme`s and `config`s
- Multiple ways to link libraries: `carthage`, `cocoapods`, `manual`
- Xcode

---

### Android

- Java/Kotlin
- `gradle` scripts
- Android Studio

---

### `Expo` exists

- It's `awesome`
- It helps people build apps without the need to go native

<Appear>

...until you `need` to go native

</Appear>

<Notes>

need to eject, back to the hard part

</Notes>

---

### JS/TS

- `babel`, `metro`, `eslint`, `typescript`, ...
- `netinfo`, `keep-awake`, `async-storage`, ...

<Notes>

only js easy

native too can go very hard

</Notes>

---

Upgrading `react` on the web meant:

- `Change the version number`
- yarn install
- `Does it work?` ðŸ˜ƒ

<Notes>

by running tests or click around

</Notes>

---

Upgrading `react native` meant:

- `Change the version number`
- yarn install
- `Does it work?` ðŸ˜ƒ
- Fix native stuff
- `Does it work now?` ðŸ™‚
- Upgrade libraries
- `Does it work yet?` ðŸ¤¨
- Fix libraries native stuff
- `Does it work, please?` ðŸ˜©
- Google things, ask for help
- `Why don't you work already?` ðŸ˜­

<Notes>

not as easy

</Notes>

---

### "Can't avoid it, let's automate it"

- `react-native upgrade`
- `rnpm upgrade`
- `react-native-git-upgrade`
- `rn-diff` repo

<Notes>

some great people thought

cant be avoided, touches many platforms

there were many iterations

</Notes>

---

I never liked using any of the `automated` tools ðŸ˜…

I only used `rn-diff`, upgrading `manually`

It helped me understand `what changed`

<Notes>

https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/tree/old/master

</Notes>

---

## Present: `pretty good` ðŸ™‚

---

- `rn-diff-purge`
- `upgrade-helper`
- `npx react-native upgrade` (`cli`)

---

### rn-diff-purge

- Stood on the shoulders of the `people` and `repos before me`
- Tries to `eliminate` previous problems
- `I` wanted this for `my` projects

<Notes>

took rn-diff

problems:

- linear upgrading, grid is better, rc
- github diffing cant handle branches

https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/tree/old/master

like most open source.. for me to use, happy if anyone else uses it too

</Notes>

---

### rn-diff-purge

- Keeps a list of diffs `from -> to` every release
- `Generated` by a script

---

### rn-diff-purge

- `Start` a new `branch` for each release
- `init` a new project based on the `template`
- `diff` and `store` as a patch file

<Notes>

Store diffs, don't depend on GitHub

from -> to every other release, with the new release

even downgrades work

https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge

https://react-native-community.github.io/rn-diff-purge

</Notes>

---

### rn-diff-purge

- `Base` of our current upgrade flow
- People already used the idea for `laravel` and `ignite bowser`
- Soon a `template repo` on GitHub, ready to be `cloned and reused`

<Notes>
create-react-app

links at the end
</Notes>

---

### upgrade-helper

- Started as `purge-web`, just pointing to the `diff` file
- Allows to choose a `from` and a `to` release
- Gives all the changes of the `init template`
- Uses `rn-diff-purge`
- Steadily becoming `more awesome`

---

### upgrade-helper

- Better visuals
- `Github-like` diff views
- See `raw` files and `download`
- File `folding`
- `Links` to release notes
- Notes `explaining` changes
- Logo and party popper ðŸŽ‰
- Support for `rc releases`

<Notes>
https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/
</Notes>

---

### npx react-native upgrade (cli)

- Just run `npx react-native upgrade`
- Uses `rn-diff-purge`
- Tries to `apply` the diff

It might not work because of differences between the template and each project

<Notes>

each project is unique

cant cover everyone, but we can cover most people, and most rn core related things

it kind of becomes your responsibility to make sure it works after an upgrade

- typescript
- fancy eslint config
- xcconfigs
- tvos

</Notes>

---

## Future: `awesome` ðŸ¤—

---

- `Autolinking` and standardization of some tools
- `rn-diff-purge` diff generation on CI
- Investigating into tools like `xcodegen`, to decouple and make easier

<Notes>
react-native doctor

with help with the upgrading, not so many differences

same as with cocoapods

libraries dont break as much

</Notes>

---

### Upgrade flow

- Get `notification` for new release
- Read the `release notes` and `change log`
- Try `npx react-native upgrade`
- Get diff from `upgrade-helper`
- Go `file-by-file` and make the changes manually
- Start with `config` and `js` stuff, then `iOS`, then `Android` native
- Make sure `any custom additions` and `modules` are compatible and working
- `Test` to make sure things still work
- Use hooks or whatever `cool new feature` is in that new release or rc ðŸ’ª

<Notes>

new release, get excited

https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases

https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/?from=0.59.10&to=0.60.0

npx r-n upgrade, even if its not perfect, report issues

</Notes>

---

### Tips

- Manual does not mean `slow`, it means `careful`
- Be mindful of `what changed`
- `Pick and choose` your changes
- Try to `stay up to date`
- Try not to `jump` too many versions
- `xcodeproj` needs some care while being changed for now

<Notes>

file by file means we pick and choose. maybe we skip a file, maybe we dont need it.

manual is not slow. its careful

xcode you need to change things in xcode, and see the diff

it will be easier in the future

</Notes>

---

### Conclusion

- Upgrading has gotten `better`, `simpler`, more `mature` and it will `keep improving`
- It might always be a `manual` process, or it might be `automatic`
- People used to say `"upgrading is hard"`
- Now people say `"that specific thing was hard while upgrading"`

<Notes>
general complaints

now its specific complaints, matured

last issue about dislike, 560 votes.
this time, complaint is 23 votes, upgrade is too often.

we are getting there
